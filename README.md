# Detective Cat (DetCat): Detecting Categorical Outliers in Relational Datasets

Poor data quality, commonly caused by data glitches such as outliers, significantly affects any data analytics task, leading to inaccurate decisions and poor predictions of the machine learning models. While detecting outliers in numerical data has been extensively studied, few attempts were made to solve the problem of detecting categorical outliers. In this repository, we provide DetCat for detecting categorical outliers in relational datasets by utilizing the syntactic structure of the values. For a given attribute, DetCat identifies a set of patterns that represents the majority of the values and declares the data values that cannot be generated by those patterns as outliers. Moreover, DetCat considers the trade-off between the expressiveness and the compactness of the generated patterns and introduces a new similarity measure between the patterns in order to reduce the false predictions.
